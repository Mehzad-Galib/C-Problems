Global variable and local variable.

Global variable can be declared anywhere in the function, and the variable itself can be used within any child function/ any function within the program.

Local variable is declared within a function or logic scope, the variable can't be used outside of the scope.

both variables can be of same name.

Global functions are used to share variable info to all functions.

Standard I/O:
printf, scanf, getchar(gettting single input from the keyboard), putchar(printing single character in the screen).

File I/O:
Read file, write a new file, appending existing file.

Step 1: Reading File:

variable: FILE *fp; // variable declaration for file pointer

function: FILE *fopen(char *name, char *mode){

}

FILE *fp;

fp = fopen("input.txt", "r"); // open input.txt in read mode

fscanf(fp, "%d", &n); // read a value from file;

fclose(fp); // close input.txt

functions to read:

fscanf(FILE *fp, char* format);

fgetc(FILE *fp);

fgets(char *array, int size, FILE *fp);

Step 2: Writing a file;

fp = fopen("output.txt", "w"); // create output.txt or blanks output.txt and edit in write mode

fprintf(fp, "%d", n); // write to file

fclose(fp);
